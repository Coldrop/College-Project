            <h3 id="enhance3">The project criteria was specified on page 6 of 13 on the assignment brief. Enhancements are to be considered anything extra that will add a "meaningful and relavent" component to the Webpage's design.</h3>
            <h3 id="enhance3">The requirements of this project include:</h3>
            <ul id="ulist">
                <li>Relavent content</li>
                <li>The HTML markup specified in the marking guide</li>
                <li>Valid HTML5 without errors</li>
                <li>Styled by a valid CSS3 file</li>
                <li>Linked to the other pages via a menu</li>
                <li>Deployed on Mercury</li>

            <br>
            <p>As seen in the top right corner of this page, the elements used to access other pages has been animated to show the user hovering over the button.
            This affect goes beyond the basic requirements as it provides a a more advanced link to other pages on the website. It qualifies as an enhancement as it
            is a form of styling not covered in the lectures or tutorials. The animation of these links is able to provide a more satisfying interaction with the Webpage
            that has been developed. The code used to create this affect can be access by clicking <a href="enhancement1code.pdf">here.</a>

            <h3 id="enhance3">The Cards</h3>
            <br>
            <p>The index/home page created by Sehaj features cards that act as more advanced buttons to lead to the other pages. They act as another option for users
                to get to different pages as they scroll down. The cards go beyond the basic requirements as they provide access to the other pages through something other
                than a basic menu. The cards are also animated when triggered by the cursor hovering, creating a more satisfying user experience. The code used to create this affect
                can be accessed by clicking <a href="enhancementcode2.pdf">here.</a>

            <h3 id="enhance3">Why is this relavent?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>As BED is a webpage development agency, these enhancements are important as they show a level of sofistication expected and met by the company.
            The high standards set by our website are able to showcase the talents of current employees and the expectations of future workers.
